## Bit

### Differentiation

Differentiation is the process of detecting a difference and it is at the root of what makes up experience. All of our sensory neurons output a difference; the neuron is either active or inactive.

---

Differentiation produces a binary representation called a BIT.

## Data

### Serialization

Serialization is the process of grouping like concepts together in succession. The benefit of serialization is that it provides an efficient way to view multiple concepts as one. Rather than having to process each individual concept on its own, all related concepts can be grouped together to be analyzed at once. Although the benefit of serialization comes from grouping multiple objects, it can be used to group as few as one concept.

In computer science, this can be viewed as an array.

BITs can be combined into DATUM (plural DATA) through the process of serialization.
