# Introduction

Humans' understanding of everything is based completely on how they experience. Thus, if one is attempting to understand anything, then they need to have an understanding of the processes of experience. Admittedly, this is a circular process as the only way a human can understand the process of experience is through experience. However, this book attempts to provide concepts that are agreed to be tautological. These concepts are then used as the foundation on which all other concepts build.
