### Association

Association is the process of specifying a concept that can substitute for another concept. This can be useful if the concept is complex and difficult to describe succinctly. As an example, instead of referring to a person by all of their distinguishing characteristics: physical features, personality, history, etc..., one can refer to them by the name that has been assigned to them.

### Sign

A SIGN is a special form of DATA that is only used in the process of association. It serves as the concept that represents the other concept.

Association is used to assign a SIGN to a DATUM. The result of this is a DEFINITION.
